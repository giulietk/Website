    "text": "Step 4: Edit the content\n\nStep 4.1: Edit the YAML file\nEdit the _site.yml file to include the metadata, layout, and theme you want for your website.\nFirst let’s take a look at a basic example of a _site.yml file for a website with one page:\nname: \"my-website\"\nnavbar:\n  title: \"My Website\"\n  left:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    theme: cosmo\nThis is the minimum you need to include in your _site.yml.\nNow let’s take a look at the _site.yml from the website repository you downloaded into \"week12-lab\". It looks like this:\nname: \"my-website\"\noutput_dir: \".\"\nnavbar:\n  title: \"PM566 Final Project\"\n  left:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Lab 12\"\n      href: 12-lab.html\n  right:\n    - icon: fa-github fa-lg\n      href: https://github.com/USCbiostats/PM566\n    - text: \"PM566 Home\"\n      href: https://uscbiostats.github.io/PM566/\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    theme: cosmo\n    include:\n      after_body: footer.html\n    css: styles.css\nInspecting this, and the output on the completed website at https://ksiegmund.github.io/PM566-lab12-example, how do you add links to internal webpages? How do you add links to external websites? How do you add icons?\nNote: recall that the output_dir field indicates which directory to copy site content into (\"_site\" is the default if none is specified). It can be \".\" to keep all content within the root website directory alongside the source code.\nNote: Preview themes here and play around with different options. Themes are easy to change even after you have added content.\nNow your task is to create a YAML for your website that includes only the essential components for your website. Either copy the content of the simple _site.yml into your own _site.yml file in your website directory PM566-final-project, or replicate it yourself line by line.\nNote: YAML language is very picky so make sure your content is formatted appropriately. If you are not sure, either look up the appropriate text in the reference guide, search google, or copy from a website you know works!\n\n\n\nStep 4.2: Edit internal .Rmd files\nEdit and create .Rmd files that contain your website content, which will produce the html pages of your website when you knit them.\nFor example, the index.Rmd could look like this:\n---\ntitle: \"PM566 Final Project\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\noutput: \n    html_document:\n        toc: TRUE\n        toc_float: TRUE\n---\n\nThis is my PM566 Final Project website.\n\nThe toc specifies whether there is a table of contents, and toc_float provides the option to float the table of contents to the left of the main document content. The floating table of contents will always be visible even when the document is scrolled. There are other options for how to display the toc in R Markdown HTML output which you can read about here.\n\nAfter you are done with your index.Rmd file, knit it to check the output. Either click the Knit option in the toolbar or in the console type rmarkdown::render_site(\"index.Rmd\"). This will render the output into a file index.html which you can check out by opening the file in your directory:"

Check them out in your directory. Most importantly, the index.html file provides a preview of the site, which you can look at in a browser as above:\n\n\n\nNote: As you make changes, you should re-render (or equivalently, re-build) the website. Recall from lecture that RStudio supports “live preview” of changes that you make to supporting files within your website (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, .Rmd partials, R scripts, and YAML config files), but this only rebuilds the active page. So once you are happy with the results of rendering you should make sure to rebuild the entire site using rmarkdown::render_site() to ensure that all pages inherit your changes.\n\n\nStyles\nYou will see that your R Markdown website comes with a style class, specified by your chosen theme specified in your YAML (or the default theme if not chosen). You can also modify your site using CSS style sheets. As discussed in lecture, styles can be modified in 3 ways: in-line with HTML, placing a style section in your HTML document, defining the CSS in an external file that is then referenced as a link in your HTML. Feel free to play around with the external style sheet styles.css that came with the example website.\n\n\n\nCommit!\nDon’t be afraid of commitment! Add your changes as you go along.\ncd ~/PM566-final-project\ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"Rendered website\""

To source this code, in your index.Rmd file, include a code chunk with the source(process_COVID_data.R) command:\n```{r load-data, echo=FALSE}\nsource(\"process_COVID_data.R\")\n```\n\nNote: Make sure that you include the following libraries and formatting code at the beginning of your index.Rmd file, which will allow you to run the source(\"process_COVID_data.R\") code:\n```{r setup, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\nYou may also want to include some code chunk options for your whole document using opts_chunk$set(), for example the options we specified in the 12-lab.Rmd file:\n```\n# Initialize code chunk options\nopts_chunk$set(\n  warning = FALSE,\n  message = FALSE,\n  eval=TRUE,\n  echo = TRUE,\n  cache = FALSE,\n  fig.width = 7, \n  fig.align = 'center',\n  fig.asp = 0.618,\n  out.width = \"700px\")\n```"
